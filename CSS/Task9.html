    <p class="yellow-background">This paragraph is enclosed within a border with 40px padding. The border adds a visual distinction to the content, creating a clear separation from the surrounding elements. The generous padding ensures that there is enough space between the text and the border, preventing it from appearing cramped. This design choice enhances readability and provides a visually pleasing presentation for the paragraph.</p>
